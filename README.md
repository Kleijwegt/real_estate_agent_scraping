## Note: This is a project that has been abandoned for a while.
Some scraping calls might not work anymore. A simple unittest file for the scraper functions is included, that can be used to check whether they still work.
Since the tests depend both on the structure of the websites of the real estate agents as well as on their current offer, some test cases might fail even though the scraping worked.

## Origin:
During 2020-2021 I started the search to buy a home. I didn't want to spend money on a buying agent (aankoopmakelaar).
And because of the fierce competition on the Dutch housing market I thought I could use my brain to get an advantage.
It appeared as if houses are first put on the website of the real estate agent before they are put on Funda
(just like houses are first available via special platforms of several buying agents).
Furthermore, by scraping my hope was to build a database that I could use to perform market analysis.
The goal of the scraper is to have an early update on the new houses on the market and to create a database of houses to perform market analysis on.

## Why I abandoned this project:
Because of the large number of real estate agents in Den Haag I would have to put a lot of time into a scraper function for each website.
Also I found out that by a real quick reply on a new "Funda" advertisement, I was still in time to get a viewing.
Simply put, the amount of work didn't seem to be worth the gain. Plus I have actually never used the results of my work.
I did actually expect this from the start, but it was fun learning how to scrape multiple websites, to reverse engineer parts of the websites, and build a databases with the content of the websites.

When we did actually find a house, and our bid was accepted the destiny of this project was sealed.
